# car_tracker
This project uses OpenCV libraries to implement a program that tracks cars on a highway. The program is designed with a basic video processing pipeline that will count the number of cars that have traveled through a certain stretch of road in either direction. 

Cars moving towards the east are marked red while ones moving west are marked green. 

This is a PROTOTYPE since the program is not finished and the tracker does not properly work yet. 
Cars are counted by the amount of frames they are detected for instead of crossing a line while the project is still in development.
